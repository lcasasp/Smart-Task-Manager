  Students struggle every day to strike a balance between their studies and 
  their free time. The link between a student's commitment and a productive 
  study regimen is provided by Task Scheduler. The software creates a 
  customized schedule based on the subjects weekly study objectives and 
  available hours entered by the user. Built-in algorithms make sure 
  that the subjects are distributed optimally, taking into account personal 
  preferences like chunking study sessions. The final schedule is displayed in a
  graphical calendar view, on a daily or weekly basis. The schedule can also be 
  displayed in a optimized format ranked by priority of tasks. All tasks are 
  able to be modified, and the final schedule can be exported, and then re-imported
  for later use.
